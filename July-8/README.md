# Self Portrait

In this image, the dark blue dots move as two different sin waves, resembling the ripples and waves of the ocean. The environment is supposed to be me floating in water. I love swimming and always feel the most relaxed and free when I'm in water, especially in nature. My most memorable moments are traveling and swimming, and my top favorite has been swimming in the Erawan Waterfalls in Thailand. I love the feeling of floating with my hair going in all directions (hence the crazy lines for hair) and seeing a whole different world underwater. 

I faced a lot of difficulty trying to plot out what I wanted with coordinates until I started using a pen and paper map out what I wanted ahead of time. I spent an unbelievably long time trying to understand curves and make my hair. I wanted curves that would show my hair off in different directions. 

I also spent a lot of time trying to understand how to make the waves for water. I found examples on making sin waves so I experimented with a for loop and the math for making the waves look different and moving at a pace I thought made sense for water.
