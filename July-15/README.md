# Space Game!

![SpaceRaceDemo](./SpaceRaceDemo.png)

I made a space race game! Utilizing classes and arrays for creating the astroids, I was able to create a game that gets harder as your points increase. As you get more points when the space ship successfully crosses without hitting astroids, the astroids get slightly faster. 
My next steps for this will be to increase the amount of astroids that show up and to have a second player so you can compete with a friend locally. I would have the second player use w and s keys for forward and backards. I also might include the ability to move left and right.
